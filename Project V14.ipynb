However, because there is no way to know when these names were given to the animals, we can't know whether the names were even in place long enough to realistically have an impact on the outcome.\n",

    "* We removed the original Age Upon Outcome column and replaced it with a new Age Upon Outcome column. \n",

We did this because we observed that the original Age Upon Outcome was just a rounded version of MonthYear minus Date of Birth, so using MonthYear minus Date of Birth without rounding provided us with a more accurate age of the animal. \n",
    "    * Because in Excel MonthYear minus Date of Birth returns the age of the animal in days, we divided this number by 365 to get the age of the animal in years. \n",

    "* We removed the DateTime column because it was exactly the same as the MonthYear column. \n",

    "\n",
    "* We created four binary columns from the Outcome Subtype column. We then dropped the Outcome Subtype column.\n",
    "    * We created the TNR binary column which stands for Trap, Neuter, Release. For this column, any stray animal that was trapped, neutered, and released back to the wild has a value of 1 in the TNR column.\n",
    "    * We created the Suffering column. For this column, any animal that was suffering at the shelter is marked with a 1. \n",
    "    * We created the Aggressive column. For this column, any aggressive animal is marked with a 1.\n",

    "It was at this point that we realized that including the Age Upon Outcome and Season attributes might not make sense because these attributes wouldn't be known until the outcome occurred. It could be argued that, because it is likely that not too much time will pass between the animal entering into the shelter and the outcome of the animal, the age of the animal upon entering the facility could be used as the input to the Age Upon Outcome attribute in our model, as an approximation of the animal's Age Upon Outcome. However, this argument is not quite so true for Season, because an animal could, for example, enter the shelter at the very end of Winter, in which case Winter would not be a good approximation of the Season in which the outcome would occur for the animal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the issues with these two attributes, we decided to try our chosen model without these attributes to see if the f-1 scores were significantly impacted. Ideally we could try all the models with these attributes dropped, but because the results of the decision tree model were still good even after dropping these attributes, we decided not to for the sake of time. \n",

    "As a side note, we also realized that TNR had a count of 0 at this point (which makes sense because none of the animals that were planned to be trapped, neutered, and released were adopted or euthanized). So, we also removed this column."
